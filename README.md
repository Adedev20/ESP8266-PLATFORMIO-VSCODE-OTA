# ESP8266-PLATFORMIO-VSCODE-OTA
ESP8266 OTA tutorials are pretty everywhere. This project was an attempt to test the OTA feature on my Nodemcu v1.0 board i had lying around using PLATFORMIO which can be found on Vscode. PLATFORMIO is a very powerful extension used by professionals to develop embedded systems. One of the things i found quite useful is the ability of this tool to autodetect the COM port your device/board is connected to. The code was originally written by Rui Santos (huge thanks). Well, testing on my board simply worked except that the button toggles and pin states were faulty on my end (something that has to do with my board). So i figured it out and fixed the code and went a step further to clean up by the main file by moving the wifi credentials to a new header file and then added it to the main file. I know it's not much but i'd to just work on something and learn from it.
